# Tri-Fleet — Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes Tri-Fleet operations to monitor performance across fleet activity, deliveries, efficiency, and service reliability. It provides an interactive, decision-ready view of key metrics to help stakeholders identify trends, bottlenecks, and opportunities to optimize fleet utilization and customer outcomes.

## Key Objectives
- Track fleet performance and operational trends over time  
- Monitor delivery/service volume and efficiency metrics  
- Identify delays, bottlenecks, and high-impact operational drivers  
- Compare performance by location/route/segment (where applicable)  
- Support data-driven decisions for planning and resource allocation  

## Dashboard Highlights
- KPI summary (operational performance at a glance)  
- Trend analysis over time  
- Breakdown by relevant categories (region/route/vehicle/segment)  
- Performance distribution and ranking views  
- Filters/slicers for interactive exploration  

## Tools Used
- Power BI (Data modeling, DAX measures, interactive visuals)
- Excel/CSV (Data preparation, cleaning—if applicable)  

## Notes
This project demonstrates end-to-end Power BI reporting: structured organization, clear storytelling, and interactive analysis designed for operational decision-making.
